                    <h2>What is Investing?</h2>
                    <p>Investing means putting your money into assets (like stocks, bonds, or funds) with the goal of growing your wealth over time. Unlike saving, which prioritizes safety, investing balances growth potential with risk.</p>

                    <h3>Why Young Adults Should Invest</h3>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Compound Growth:</strong> Time is your biggest advantage—small investments grow significantly over decades</li>
                        <li><strong>Wealth Building:</strong> Beat inflation and grow wealth faster than with savings alone</li>
                        <li><strong>Early Retirement:</strong> Start now and retire with more security and freedom</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Goals:</strong> Achieve big goals like buying a home or starting a business</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-Term Stability:</strong> Build assets that support your future independence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Investment Types for Beginners</h3>
                    
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Stocks</h4>
                        <p>Own a piece of a company. Stocks offer growth potential but come with higher risk. Start with index funds (diversified bundles of stocks) for beginners.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Bonds</h4>
                        <p>Loans you give to companies or governments. They provide steady income with lower risk than stocks. Good for conservative investors.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Index Funds & ETFs</h4>
                        <p>Funds that track market indices (like S&P 500). They're diversified, low-cost, and perfect for beginners. This is how most successful long-term investors build wealth.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Retirement Accounts (401k, IRA)</h4>
                        <p>Tax-advantaged accounts designed for long-term investing. Employer 401(k) matching is free money—always take full advantage if available.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Getting Started with Investing</h3>
                    <ol class="content-list">
                        <li>Build an emergency fund first (3-6 months of expenses)</li>
                        <li>Pay off high-interest debt (credit cards)</li>
                        <li>Open a brokerage account (Vanguard, Fidelity, Charles Schwab)</li>
                        <li>Start with low-cost index funds (e.g., total market index fund)</li>
                        <li>Invest regularly (even $50/month makes a difference)</li>
                        <li>Keep investing through market ups and downs</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Key Investment Principles</h3>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Start Early:</strong> A 25-year-old investing $100/month at 7% return has $250K+ by 65</li>
                        <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Don't put all eggs in one basket—spread investments across different asset types</li>
                        <li><strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging:</strong> Invest regular amounts regardless of market conditions</li>
                        <li><strong>Think Long-Term:</strong> Don't panic sell during market downturns—stay focused on 10+ year goals</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep Costs Low:</strong> High fees eat into returns—choose low-cost index funds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Common Investment Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Investing money you'll need in less than 5 years</li>
                        <li>Panic selling when the market drops</li>
                        <li>Trying to time the market or chase hot stocks</li>
                        <li>Not diversifying enough</li>
                        <li>Paying high fees (aim for 0.1-0.3% expense ratios)</li>
                        <li>Putting emotions before strategy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
                    <p><strong>At age 25:</strong> Invest $200/month in an index fund at 7% average annual return.</p>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>By age 35: ~$35,000</li>
                        <li>By age 45: ~$105,000</li>
                        <li>By age 65: ~$625,000</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The same investment started at age 35 would only reach ~$230,000 by 65. Time is your superpower!</p>
