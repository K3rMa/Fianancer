                    <h2>Understanding Debt & Credit</h2>
                    <p>Debt isn't bad—it's a tool that helps you afford things now while you pay for them later. The key is using it responsibly and building good credit, which opens doors to better financial opportunities.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Debt</h3>
                    
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Good Debt vs. Bad Debt</h4>
                        <p><strong>Good Debt:</strong> Investments in your future (education, home, car) with reasonable interest rates and clear benefits.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bad Debt:</strong> High-interest debt on depreciating items (credit cards, payday loans) that doesn't improve your financial position.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Common Debt Types</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Credit Card Debt:</strong> High interest (15-25%+), flexible but expensive</li>
                            <li><strong>Student Loans:</strong> Lower interest (4-7%), long repayment terms</li>
                            <li><strong>Auto Loans:</strong> Moderate interest (3-8%), secured by the vehicle</li>
                            <li><strong>Mortgages:</strong> Low interest (3-7%), secured by the home</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Loans:</strong> Varies (6-36%), unsecured, quick approval</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>What is Credit?</h3>
                    <p>Your credit score is a number (300-850) that shows lenders how likely you are to repay debt. Higher scores mean better rates and more borrowing power.</p>

                    <h3>What Affects Your Credit Score?</h3>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Payment History (35%):</strong> Pay bills on time every time</li>
                        <li><strong>Credit Utilization (30%):</strong> Use less than 30% of your credit limit</li>
                        <li><strong>Length of Credit (15%):</strong> Older accounts help (don't close old credit cards)</li>
                        <li><strong>Credit Mix (10%):</strong> Different types of credit (cards, loans, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>New Credit (10%):</strong> Limit new credit applications in short time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Building Good Credit</h3>
                    <ol class="content-list">
                        <li>Get a credit card (secured card if needed) and use it responsibly</li>
                        <li>Pay all bills on time—set up automatic payments if helpful</li>
                        <li>Keep credit card balances low (under 30% of limit)</li>
                        <li>Check your credit report yearly at annualcreditreport.com (free)</li>
                        <li>Correct any errors on your report immediately</li>
                        <li>Don't close old credit cards—they help your score</li>
                        <li>Limit new credit applications to necessary ones</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Managing Debt Responsibly</h3>
                    
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Debt Payoff Strategy: Snowball Method</h4>
                        <p>Pay off smallest debts first, then use that money on larger debts. This builds momentum and motivation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h4>Debt Payoff Strategy: Avalanche Method</h4>
                        <p>Pay off highest interest debt first (usually credit cards). This saves you the most money on interest.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>If You're Struggling with Debt</h3>

                        <li>Create a list of all debts with amounts and interest rates</li>
                        <li>Contact creditors to negotiate lower rates or payment plans</li>
                        <li>Consider debt consolidation for lower interest</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Credit Score Ranges</h3>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Poor (300-619):</strong> Limited access to credit, high interest rates</li>
                        <li><strong>Fair (620-679):</strong> Access to credit, higher rates than good credit</li>
                        <li><strong>Good (680-739):</strong> Decent access, reasonable rates</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Common Credit Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

                        <li>Getting payday loans or other predatory lending</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Building Your Financial Future</h3>
                    <p>Good credit opens doors: lower interest rates on loans, better insurance rates, easier apartment rental, and even job opportunities. Start building now while you're young—good credit compounds over time just like investments do.</p>
